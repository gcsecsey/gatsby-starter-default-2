ğŸš€ This is a fork of the [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) template, so far serving as a landing page.

ğŸ§ª I'm currently using this project mostly to experiment with the capabilities of Gatsby.js and Netlify.

ğŸ“º Stay tuned for more functionality, and in the meantime check out [the shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/quirkyhedgehog)!
